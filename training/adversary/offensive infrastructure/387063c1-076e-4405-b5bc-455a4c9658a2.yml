name: Basic concepts of Command and Control (C2) systems
challenge: |
  What tab within Operator allows you to manage agents, ranges, and launch adversaries?
context: |
  Many adversaries including both good and bad actors today have a command and conrtol system to conduct offensive
  cyber operations. Learning the basic concepts of C2 systems enable red teamers the ability to more effectively

  Command and Control (C2) Systems: |
    A Command and Control (C2) system in the context of cybersecurity enables the centralized management of remote
    systems. For adversaries, a C2 system enables the ability to conduct targeted campaigns more effectively.
    The majority of adversaries today utilize C2 sytems to conduct their attacks. Their are many C2 systems
    that exsist both commercially, open source, and proprietary. Finding a C2 is not difficult in todays landscape, but
    finding one that allows you to perform your work effectively and efficently is highly debated among experts.
  Command and Control Extendability: |
    Most important aspect of C2 systems is the ability to adapt. Its critical that a C2 operator can effortlessly and
    effectively perform the engagement with little to no having to move to other non-integrated tools. The ability for
    a C2 system to integrate with known tools and easily adapt to newly developed capabilities is citical in its design
    priciples.
