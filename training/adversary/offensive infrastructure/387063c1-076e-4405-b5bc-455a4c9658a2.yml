name: Basic concepts of Command and Control (C2) systems
challenge: |
  What tab within Operator allows you to manage agents, ranges, and launch adversaries?
context: |
  Many adversaries including both good and bad actors today have a command and conrtol system to conduct offensive
  cyber operations. Learning the basic concepts of C2 systems enable red teamers the ability to more effectively
  conduct operations and enables blue teamers the ability to more effectively understand and potentially discover
  agents on their network.

  Command and Control (C2) Systems: |
    A Command and Control (C2) system in the context of cybersecurity enables the centralized management of remote
    systems. For adversaries, a C2 system enables the ability to conduct targeted campaigns more effectively.
    The majority of adversaries today utilize C2 sytems to conduct their attacks. Their are many C2 systems
    that exsist both commercially, open source, and proprietary. Finding a C2 is not difficult in todays landscape, but
    finding one that allows you to perform your work effectively and efficently is highly debated among experts.
  Agents/Implants: |
    Agents or Implants enable the communication between the target and the C2. The C2 then conducts the agent to perform
    tasking.

    Agents normally communicate back to the C2 in two ways. Beaconing allows the adversay to be stealthy by instructing
    the agent to communicate back usually by an interval of time or in some cases when an action performed on the target
    occurs. In this senario, an adversay normally has proceedures lined up ready for when the next beacon occurs.
    Interactive is a less stealthy way to communicate to the agent but, provides a constant network stream allowing the
    adversary to perform attacks live. In some cases, an agent has the ability to perform both beaconing and interactive
    modes where an adversary will utilize beaconing to discover, plan, and setup the target and then if deemed necessary
    uses interactive to complete the objective on the target swiftly.

    Agents or implants of the past would harness all of their capabilities within the binary. An objective of any agent
    developer is develop an agent that is small and has the ability to live on a wide varriety of targets. Advanced
    agents today are developed more like frameworks and can load and unload capabilities to the binary when needed.
    This cuts down on binary size and if the agent is discovered you are less likely to burn your capabilities.
    The collection of agent capabilities within a single binary is usually denoted by a staging number. A Stage 0 agent
    is usually denoted as a very small binary that is designed to just get on the target and beacon back. The adversay
    loses little to nothing if the binary is discovered. A Stage 1 implant....
  Command and Control Extendability: |
    Most important aspect of C2 systems is the ability to adapt. Its critical that a C2 operator can effortlessly and
    effectively perform the engagement with little to no having to move to other non-integrated tools. The ability for
    a C2 system to integrate with known tools and easily adapt to newly developed capabilities is citical in its design
    priciples.
