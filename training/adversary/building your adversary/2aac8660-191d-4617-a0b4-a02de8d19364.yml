name: Create a new procedure
challenge: |
  Can you create a new TTP? It should have a name of 'fall asleep' and be
  classified as an Execution tactic with a technique of 'Command and Scripting Interpreter'.
context: |
  One of the unique aspects of Operator is the ability to quickly create your own TTPs and load them in the system.
  By simply creating a new YML file and ensuring the format matches that of other files in the Community repository, you
  are able to import them either manually or through Operator itself (can you find the import button?). TTPs
  are written in a format which allows for you to describe 1+ platforms and 1+ executors per platform. Read
  about the TTP files in the documentation for a full tutorial. The point of this flag is to teach you how to create a TTP
  within Operator - not train you on writing custom attacks. In your new TTP, see if you can figure out the syntax to
  make the agent executing it pause for 5 seconds.

hints:
  - Look for the + button inside the Editor section
  - Did you save the TTP after creating it?

  Choosing a platform & executor: |
    Each TTP requires a platform (operating system) and executor (program the agent uses to run the TTP). There are 3 supported
    platforms in Operator today: windows, linux and darwin (another word for MacOS). By default, each platform can use
    a specific set of executors. Check the documentation around TTPs for a list of options.
  Adding Additional Proceedures: |
    Operator includes a plugin called ART, which allows you to import the hundreds of TTPs available in the open-source
    Atomic Red Team project. Use this to bolster the number of attacks in your Operator instance.
  Additional Additions to Proceedures Outside Editor: |
    When creating proceedures inside editor you can create additional information that the current editor does not support during creation. For example,
    if you want your proceedure to be linked to a chain you will need to export the proceedure add "chains" to the yml file and then import the proceedure
    which will update it inside Operator. 
  Similar Proceedures: |
    After you create a proceedure, within the information section, if Operator believes your proceedure has similar characteristics to an already created 
    proceedure it will link to it. This helps avoid duplication of proceedures. If you linked proceedure is similar but not exact you can go into the linked 
    proceedure and create a varrant.  
answer:
  script: Number(Object.values(Attack.attack).filter(atk => atk.name.toLowerCase() === 'fall asleep').length)
  value: 1
